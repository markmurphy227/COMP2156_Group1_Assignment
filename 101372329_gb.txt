I have never seen the inside of the GBC campus as a student !  

The last time I was in the Davenport campus was in the 1990s.  I saw BIG SUGAR play at the dental college.  It was an important evening for me personally.

When I was temporarily renting office space on Jarvis during the sale of my last business to a publicly traded company, we had a lot of people working in one room with only one bathroom.

As such, we instructed the employees to use the College bathrooms, and that is my primary modern memory of the physical campuses.
